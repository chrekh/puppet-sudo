# sudo

Puppet module for configuring sudo. **Not yet ready for production!**
there is still a important decision to make about default sudoers config.

## Description

Installs and configures sudo.

This modules can configure most features described in sudoers(5), both in the
master sudoers file, and in separate files located in a includedir
(/etc/sudoers.d). My motivation for creating this module even when there is
several modules for sudo available already, is to be able to to generate all
possible sudoers(5) content, using structured data merged from possibly several
hiera levels.

Note that there is no verification of the resulting sudoers files, so it's very
possible to generate sudoers content that breaks sudo.

## Todo

I have still not decided if it's a good idea to provide os-dependent default
configuration for the primary sudoers file.  I need to make a definitive
decision before releasing 1.0

If you test this module, pleas tell me your opinion about this, either by mail
to che@chrekh.se or using the issues url.


## Usage

```puppet
class { 'sudo': }
```

The main feature is located in a single hash provided to sudo as parameter
conf. This is possible to specify either as class-parameter or hieradata.

The keys in $sudo::conf is what file to write configurations to, the special
key '_sudoers' is used for the main sudo configuration file $sudo::sudoers
(normally '/etc/sudoers'), other keys specifies files to create under
$sudo::includedir (normally /etc/sudoers.d)

The value for $sudo::conf[file] can be one of:

* mode, File permission mode for the file, default $sudo::defaultmode
* defaults, Defaults specifications as described by sudoers(5)
* user_alias, A hash whith array of users.
* runas_alias, A hash with array of target users.
* host_alias, A hash with array of hosts.
* cmnd_alias, A hash with array of commands.
* user_specs, A array of hashes with user specs with
  - users: Array of users
  - runas: Hash of target user & group
  - options: Array of options
  - commands: Array of commands

## Note about default value for sudo::conf[_sudoers]

My objective is to provide os-dependent value for the generated sudoers that is
similar to the default sudoers on that os. This might cause difficulties to
generate wanted content, so I might remove the os-dependent defaults in later
releases.  Let me know your opinion on this.

For example the default on os[family] RedHat is to have
"DefaultsÂ always_set_home", if that is not desirable you can chose to negate it
by adding !always_set_home

## Hiera example

```yaml
---
lookup_options:
  sudo::conf:
    merge:
      strategy: deep
sudo::conf:
  _sudoers:
    defaults:
      - Defaults:
          - insults
          - '!always_set_home'
```

This will result in /etc/sudoers on os[family] RedHat containing

```
## Managed by puppet class sudo
## Do not edit

# Override built-in defaults
Defaults !visiblepw, always_set_home
Defaults match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin
Defaults env_reset
Defaults env_keep =  "COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS"
Defaults env_keep += "MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY"
Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
Defaults insults, !always_set_home

# User specification
root ALL = (ALL:ALL)  ALL
%wheel ALL = (ALL:ALL)  ALL

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

... and /usr/local/etc/sudoers on os[family] FreeBSD with

```
## Managed by puppet class sudo
## Do not edit

# Override built-in defaults
Defaults insults, !alwayw_set_home

# User specification
root ALL = (ALL)  ALL

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /usr/local/etc/sudoers.d
```

There is also a quite large example in [HIERA_EXAMPLE.md](https://github.com/chrekh/puppet-sudo/blob/main/HIERA_EXAMPLE.md)
based on the examples in sudoers(5), which will results in
/etc/sudoers.d/example with content [EXAMPLE.md](https://github.com/chrekh/puppet-sudo/blob/main/EXAMPLE.md)
