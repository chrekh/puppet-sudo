## Description

Installs and configures sudo.

This modules can configure most features described in sudoers(5), both in one
main files, and in separate files located in a includedir (/etc/sudoers.d)

## Todo

There still remains some work to do before this can be used in production
environments. Use this only for testing it.  I appreciate suggestions for
improvements (preferably by pull requests)

Since the most important method for controlling this module is with the quite
complex hash $sudo::conf the datastructure needs to be documented a lot
more. For now it's mainly documented by example.

The datastructure for $sudo::conf might also need some redesigning.

## Usage

```puppet
class { 'sudo': }
```

The main feature is located in a single hash provided to sudo as parameter
conf. This is possible to specify either as class-parameter or hieradata.

The keys in $sudo::conf is what file to write configurations to, the special
key '_sudoers' is used for the main sudo configuration file $sudo::sudoers
(normally '/etc/sudoers'), other keys specifies files to create under
$sudo::includedir (normally /etc/sudoers.d)

The value for $sudo::conf[file] can be one of:

* mode, File permission mode for the file, default $sudo::defaultmode
* defaults, Defaults specifications as described by sudoers(5)
* user_alias, A hash whith array of users.
* runas_alias, A hash with array of target users.
* host_alias, A hash with array of hosts.
* cmnd_alias, A hash with array of commands.
* user_specs, A array of hashes with user specs with
** users: Array of users
** runas: Hash of target user & group
** options: Array of options
** commands: Array of commands

## Note about default value for sudo::conf[_sudoers]

My objective is to provide os-dependent value for the generated sudoers that is
similar to the default sudoers on that os. This might cause difficulties to
generate wanted content, so I might remove the os-dependent defaults in later
releases.  Let me know your opinion on this.

For example the default on os[family] RedHat is to have
"DefaultsÂ always_set_home", if that is not desirable you can chose to negate it
by adding !always_set_home

## Hiera example

```yaml
---
lookup_options:
  sudo::conf:
    merge:
      strategy: deep
sudo::conf:
  _sudoers:
    defaults:
      - Defaults:
          - insults
          - '!alwayw_set_home'
```

This will result in /etc/sudoers on os[family] RedHat containing

```
## Managed by puppet class sudo
## Do not edit

# Override built-in defaults
Defaults !visiblepw, always_set_home
Defaults match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin
Defaults env_reset
Defaults env_keep =  "COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS"
Defaults env_keep += "MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY"
Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
Defaults insults, !alwayw_set_home

# User specification
root ALL = (ALL:ALL)  ALL
%wheel ALL = (ALL:ALL)  ALL

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

... and /usr/local/etc/sudoers on os[family] FreeBSD with

```
## Managed by puppet class sudo
## Do not edit

# Override built-in defaults
Defaults insults, !alwayw_set_home

# User specification
root ALL = (ALL)  ALL

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /usr/local/etc/sudoers.d
```

There is also a quite large example in [HIERA_EXAMPLE.md](https://github.com/chrekh/puppet-sudo/blob/main/HIERA_EXAMPLE.md)
based on the examples in sudoers(5), which will results in
/etc/sudoers.d/example with content [EXAMPLE.md](https://github.com/chrekh/puppet-sudo/blob/main/EXAMPLE.md)
